These files are used in the covers/ subdirectory for each TUGboat issue,
and either don't have to be routinely changed or may be useful as
starting points of the process, so are checked in here.

cover2.tex and tbcomplete.lua definitely have to be changed for each
issue.  It's not unusual to have to change the other cover*.tex files,
or the macros.
