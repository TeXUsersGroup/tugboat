LaTeX macros for use in TUGboat
===============================

The files in this directory will generate both a TUGboat articles
class and a TUG conference proceedings class.

These macros *are* supported; please do *not* bother the TUGboat
editor with queries about the macros (or the TUGboat proceedings
editor, if you're preparing an article for submission to a TUG
conference).  Bother me, instead (the editors do, in any case, so you
might as well short-circuit them ;-)

See the TUGboat web pages at http://tug.org/TUGboat for back issues,
guidelines for authors, etc.  We greatly appreciate new article
submissions!

Installation and use:
=====================

The directory contains three files containing TeX code:

  tugboat.dtx  -- the source for the macros
  tugboat.ins  -- the docstrip instructions
  ltubguid.ltx -- documentation for the macros (published in TUGboat
                  52, but revised since)

other files are
  ltugbib.bst  -- a BibTeX style to match ltugboat.cls's default
                  biblio capabilities
  ltubguid.pdf -- browsable user documentation
  tugboat.pdf  -- browsable implementation documentation

Processing the .ins file produces:

  ltugboat.cls -- For preparing articles for regular issues of TUGboat
  ltugproc.cls -- For preparing articles for conference proceedings
  ltugboat.sty -- The usual `obsolete file' warning
  ltugproc.sty -- The usual `obsolete file' warning
  ltugcomn.sty -- Used when processing tugboat.dtx for its
                  documentation content

The procedure for using the macros should therefore be:

  process the .ins file
  move the .sty and .cls to "somewhere LaTeX will search"
  move the .bib to "somewhere BibTeX will search"
  move the browsable documentation to "somewhere texdoc will search"

On a TDS installation, common search locations are:

  $TEXMF/tex/latex/tugboat (for .sty, .cls)
  $TEXMF/bibtex/bst/misc   (for .bst)
  $TEXMF/doc/latex/tugboat (for .pdf)

($TEXMF being a pointer to the root of a TDS tree, preferably a local
one, to avoid tangling with future releases of your TeX distribution.)

`User-level' documentation is provided in file ltubguid.pdf, which is
 a revised version of a TUGboat paper.  The documented source of the
 macros is also provided in readily readable form, as tugboat.pdf.
