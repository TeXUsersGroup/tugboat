# Extra information about authors.
# LHS is an author name, after unification and transformations.
# Remaining entries are the information that can't be discerned automatically.
# 
# This is used in the doi process, so that we can properly record the
# contributor information.
#
# The names here must be specified as they appear in the .rpi file.

# These author names will end up as a Crossref <organization>
# instead of a <person_name> in the <contributors> list.

# We support \ORCID in the (La)TeX styles to typeset these numbers.
# It would be nice to verify the values, or notice they're missing.
#
# For the present, people must be added here by hand. Nothing else will
# get the values into the output.
