.rpi/.html files written by captub for TUB crossref processing. Public domain.
Originally written 2020 Karl Berry.

See ../README (i.e., the README in the crossref/ subdirectory) for the
general story on our doi setup.

This crossref/dir0.capout subdirectory is written into by the capsule
processing script (captub), specifically by the function
capcrossref.pl::crossref_write_files. It contains the rpi files
describing each article and the initial version of the html landing pages.

The files written here are temporary and intermediate, and are not
committed to version control. They're cleaned on every run of cr-do-issue.
