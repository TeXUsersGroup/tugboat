.rpi and .xml files in the process of being uploaded. Public domain.
Originally written 2020 Karl Berry.

See ../README (i.e., the README in the crossref/ subdirectory) for the
general story on our doi story and ../Makefile for the exact steps.

This crossref/process directory is a temporary holding space while we
doing an upload to Crossref. The files here start as autogenerated (in
../rpi/*) from the capsule sources (../*.txt) and may indeed just be
copies of those autogenerated files, plus the xml files that we generate
and upload.

The files written here are temporary and intermediate, and are not
committed to version control. After successful upload, we copy them to
../uploaded for posterity.
