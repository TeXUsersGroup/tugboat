When writing a book with a mathematical, scientific or technical background, 
the output of programs is often  inserted as text or an illustration;
in many cases, also with complete or partial indication of the respective source code. 
As an author, you have the problem of keeping such external sample
programs in sync with the current manuscript. If you keep the source
code in the book manuscript itself, and create the external examples at
the same time as typesetting the main document, you can be sure the code
and output stay consistent.
