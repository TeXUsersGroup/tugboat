The Mac previewer TeXShop provides a preview window for each open document, showing pdf output. Version 5 of the program
provides an extra preview window for html output.
Therefore, TeXShop authors can use  typesetting engines which convert source files to pdf, or html, or both. Examples include \TeX4ht, which accepts \LaTeX\ source and outputs html,  Pre\TeX{}t, which accepts \XML\ source and outputs either pdf or html, and pure html source, which can be displayed as a live web page.
