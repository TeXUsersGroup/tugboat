This article combines two talks at the \acro{TUG} 2024 conference, one about \TeX\ (Live) at arXiv,
and one about accessibility and \HTML\ papers. We will give a short introduction
of what arXiv is and its importance for open science. After this introduction, the 
first part deals with how we use \TeX\ at arXiv, followed by a second part on
improving accessibility at arXiv.
