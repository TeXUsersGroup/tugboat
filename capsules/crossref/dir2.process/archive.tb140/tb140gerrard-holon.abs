One of the main inspirations for literate
programming was a technical report entitled {\sl Holon Programming:\ A Survey}, by Pierre-Arnoul de Marneffe. It was 
privately circulated among computer
scientists in 1973.
The document thereafter became a Borgesian mythical book, existing only in citations by Knuth. This article narrates the search-and-rescue mission of this rare book, and highlights a few of its innovations. The full report is available at \tburl{github.com/holon-scribe/holon-programming}.
