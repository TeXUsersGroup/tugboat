Distributing \TeX{} software on physical media has been a mission
of the \TeX{} user groups since their earliest days.
As of 2024, with wide availability of high-speed permanent access to the
Internet,
the user groups agreed to switch the way this service is provided:
the \DVD{}s\ are now produced and shipped only on demand, by a group of volunteers
spread over the world. For information and to make requests, see
\url{https://tug.org/dvd}.
