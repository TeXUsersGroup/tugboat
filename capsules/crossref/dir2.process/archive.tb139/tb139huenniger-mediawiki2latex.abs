The MediaWiki2Latex program converts wiki content to \LaTeX\  and 
other formats. It has been more than 10 years since we last mentioned 
it in \TUB\ (\TUB\ 34:2, ``Converting Wikipedia articles to
\LaTeX'', \url{https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb34-2/tb107huenniger.pdf}) so
there is quite a bit of news to report.
