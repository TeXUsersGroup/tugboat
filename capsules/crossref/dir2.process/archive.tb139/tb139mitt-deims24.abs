  At the \acro{TUG} 2020 online conference the \LaTeX{} Project Team
  announced the start of a multi-year project to enhance \LaTeX{} so
  that it will fully and naturally support the creation of structured
  document formats, in particular the \enquote{tagged \PDF} format as
  required by accessibility standards such as \acro{PDF/UA}.

  In this talk we present the current achievements of this
  project
  and the issues we encountered along the way. We also outline open
  areas of research and the future steps that we shall take to
  automatically produce well-tagged \PDF\ that supports accessible
  standards (in particular, the recently finalized \acro{PDF/UA-2}) as well
  as general reuse and further conversions. This will be achieved by
  embedding in the \PDF\ a comprehensive description of the document
  structure.

  This project is carried out by a small number of
  developers. Besides the authors, the following individuals from
  the \LaTeX{} Project Team are actively involved:
   Chris Rowley,
   David Carlisle,
   Joseph Wright,
   Marcel Kr√ºger, and
   Phelype Oleinik.

  We also wish to acknowledge the contributions from various
  members of the \TeX{} community and beyond; these have been made
  through comments and suggestions, and more recently through the
  testing of the new functionality made available in the form of
  prototype implementations. Without such feedback it would be
  difficult to finish this project with satisfactory results.
