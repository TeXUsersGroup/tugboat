        Alignment structures are created in plain \TeX\ using one of
three methods: tabbing, horizontal or vertical alignment. Tabbing
might be the easiest method; horizontal alignment with \cs{halign} has
more complicated instructions. Both methods are described in great
detail in Chapter~22 of \TB. Vertical alignment with \cs{valign} is
only briefly mentioned in \TB; this might be the reason why it's
rarely used. This article looks at \cs{valign} and presents a few
tables that might benefit from it.
