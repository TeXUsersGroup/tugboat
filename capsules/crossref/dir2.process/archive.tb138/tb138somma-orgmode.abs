In writing academic or technical articles, you can reduce complexity by
using markup or configurations, dropping the \LaTeX{} \emph{markup language},
and adopting ORG-mode\ in Emacs while retaining \LaTeX's high
typographical quality. This article shows how ORG\ markup exported to
\LaTeX{} works. Also, it explains the attributes of the most common
elements of academic papers, such as links, tables, notes, figures, and
bibliographic references. Finally, in the appendix, as a practical
project, the author's choices for delivering the original article
following the typographical rules of ArsTeXnica{} are documented.
