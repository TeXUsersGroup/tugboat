We recently worked on accents in math in \CONTEXT. While looking at the bottom 
accents, we realized that there was work to be done, since Microsoft did not 
specify how to deal with them (there is support for bottom accents built in to 
\LUAMETATEX). While discussing and examining examples, we noticed that fonts 
behave differently, once again.
