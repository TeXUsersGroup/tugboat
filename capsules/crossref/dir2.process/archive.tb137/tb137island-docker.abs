Over the course of the last year(s), the Island of \TeX\ has 
received quite some interest in its Docker containers. This article gives a

\ConTeXt, including some examples on using our containers in production 
environments. Last but not least, we will elaborate on some interesting 
(mostly still open) problems connected to containerizing \TeX\ Live.
