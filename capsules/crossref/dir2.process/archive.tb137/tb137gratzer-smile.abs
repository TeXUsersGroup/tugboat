The fifth edition of my \emph{Math into \LaTeX} book is still selling well,
but it is seven years old.
A lot has changed. 
All \TeX\ files, \BibTeX\ and MakeIndex files changed
from \ASCII\ to \tbUTF-8. 
Lots of work has been done for references, further developing and
enhancing \BibTeX.
And a lot more \dots

So I started contemplating a sixth edition, a huge undertaking. 
For instance, the Bib\LaTeX\ manual alone is about 350 pages and 
I would have to read at least ten like that.

And then the gods smiled at me \dots.

First smile: \titleref{The \LaTeX\ Companion}, third edition.

Second smile: ChatGPT.
