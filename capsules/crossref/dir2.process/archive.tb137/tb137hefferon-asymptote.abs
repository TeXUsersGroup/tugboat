Asymptote{} is a vector graphics language for technical
drawing that fits very well with \TeX, \LaTeX{}, and friends. 
It deserves to be more widely known.

One appealing thing is
that it is in part based on algorithms from \MF{} and \MP{} but
it extends those to three dimensions. 
I'll discuss a couple of workflow
issues that a beginner to Asymptote{} who is coming from \MP{} might
find useful, in particular using a single source file to output many
related graphics.
