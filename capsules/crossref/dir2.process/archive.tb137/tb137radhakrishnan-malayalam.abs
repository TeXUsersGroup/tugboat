  Malayalam is an Indic script with numerous shape-shifting characters.
  We explore a reusable component-based design for Malayalam fonts, and
  develop them using \MF/\MP\ [6,1] to assemble the
  characters. We discuss the paradigm shift from \acro{GUI} design tools
  to `code-based' design of shapes and glyphs, even by non-coders, and
  the advantages and challenges of using \MF/\MP\ to develop an OpenType
  font for a complex script. Finally, the progress made by our small
  team is shared.
