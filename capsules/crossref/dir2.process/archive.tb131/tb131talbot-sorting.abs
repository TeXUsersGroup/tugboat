When using \app{makeindex} and \app{xindy}, it's advisable to
provide a sort value when the actual value contains commands or
other awkward content that can confuse sorting. With \app{bib2gls},
which was written specifically for the \sty{glossaries-extra}
package, the advice is the reverse. In general you shouldn't
explicitly supply the sort value but instead make use of
\app{bib2gls}'s system of fallbacks. This provides a more flexible
approach that makes it easier to share \texttt{bib} files across multiple
documents that may require different ordering.
