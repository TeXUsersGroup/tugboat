xml and constituents in preparation for upload to crossref.
Originally written 2020 Karl Berry.

See ../README (i.e., the README in the crossref/ subdirectory) for the
general story on our doi story.

This crossref/dir2.process directory is a temporary holding space for
preparing to upload an issue to crossref for doi registration. An
issue.xml file is created for a whole issue, with the rpi and bbl
information going into it.

This is the place where abs/bbl files which need to get hand-edited are
preserved. Thus, new abs/bbl files get copied into here, but existing
ones are never overwritten.

The html landing pages here are not used and are merely copied in for
convenience

The files written here are temporary, and are not committed to version
control. After successful upload, we copy them to ../dir3.uploaded for
archival.
