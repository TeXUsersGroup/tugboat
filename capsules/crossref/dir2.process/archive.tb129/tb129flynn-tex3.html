<p><b>Abstract</b>:
While clearing out cupboards during lockdown, I came
across several oddities, including this review of
TeX3 which <tt>.exe</tt> magazine asked me for
in April 1991, during negotiations into being taken over. They
subsequently collapsed as a print publication, and the article
was therefore never published, meaning it&#x2019;s still my
copyright. It was interesting to see what I had picked up on
for them, as they had asked me to write it from the point of
view of a new TeX user with experience in other systems.</p>
<p>It referenced five figures which were long since lost, but
which I have reconstructed from memory and the descriptions.
The original was formatted in unmarked monospace, according to
the publisher&#x2019;s requirements. This version has been used
without substantive textual change for TUGboat, but the plaintext
symbolic notations like <tt>&#x005c;TeX&#x005c;</tt> have
been replaced with the genuine logos, acronyms and
URIs have been marked, some previously
unnoticed typos have been corrected, and oddities of plaintext
markup have been converted to LaTeX.</p>
<p>Most companies, addresses, electronic access, etc., mentioned no longer
exist. The references are kept as a matter of nostalgia and history.</p>
