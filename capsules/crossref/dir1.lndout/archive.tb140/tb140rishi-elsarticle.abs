The \verb+elsarticle.cls+, \verb+cas-sc.cls+, and \verb+cas-dc.cls+ classes are
the preferred \LaTeX\ class files recommended by Elsevier, a publishing
company specializing in scientific, technical, and medical (\acro{STM})
content for manuscript submissions to their journals. These class files
are available on \CTAN\ along with templates, Bib\TeX\ style files, and
user documentations. In this article, we will mainly explore the
purpose, features and benefits of these class files and how to utilize
these packages effectively for their intended purposes. We also list
the challenges resulting from not using these recommended templates.
