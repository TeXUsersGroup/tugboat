	Large parts of the Latin literature are written in verse: Virgil's \AE neid and Ovid's Metamorphoses are two well-known examples. As can be noticed from a glance at most specialised textbooks, typesetting the scansion of Latin verses is not trivial. To this end, analysing the syllable quantity, or duration, is required\Dash this is prosody.
	Conventionally, prosody is denoted with diacritical marks, typically above the vowel of a syllable.
	Although {\LaTeX} provides such a feature, it is not always simple to adjust it to authors' needs. In this short note, several issues arising from the scansion of Latin verses in both {\LaTeX} and {Lua\LaTeX} are discussed and technical solutions are described.
