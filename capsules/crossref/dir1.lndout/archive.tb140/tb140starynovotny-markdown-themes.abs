The Markdown package for \TeX{} supports themes that allow
\TeX nicians to tailor the presentation of Markdown and \acro{YAML} content
on the page. In this article, I will show the current state of Markdown
themes using the example of \LaTeX{} templates that I developed for the
International Software Testing Qualifications Board (\acro{ISTQB}).
Readers will leave with actionable steps to create or modify Markdown
themes for \LaTeX, and insights into extending these principles to other
\TeX{} engines.
