We report an experiment of making the proceedings of a conference by
automatically generating as much information as possible. For example, we look
for titles and other metadata in successive source files to build the table of
contents. Separate source files must be processed by a \TeX-like format, which
may be pdf\LaTeX, \XeLaTeX, \LuaLaTeX\ or \ConTeXt. Installing our functions
requires a \textsc{Unix}-like \texttt{make} command and some programs written
mostly using \pgScheme, partly using \pgRuby.
