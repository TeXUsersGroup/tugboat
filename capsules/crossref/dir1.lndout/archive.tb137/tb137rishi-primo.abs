Primo is a cutting-edge, cloud-based authoring, submission, and
proofing framework that provides a sustainable solution for academic
publishing. It combines the advantages of \XML-based workflows that
facilitate controlled authoring and/or editing in accordance with
specific \DTD{}s and house styles, with the visually appealing and
mathematically precise typesetting language of \TeX, enabling the
creation of high-quality \PDF{}s and mathematical images (offering an
alternative to \MathML\ coding).

By speaking the widely accepted communicating lingua franca of mathematics and
science (i.e., \TeX), and utilizing the \XML/\MathML\ format for
archiving, Primo has the potential to revolutionize the publishing
industry. This tool caters to both the author and the publisher,
bringing their needs together with enhanced participation of authors in
the publishing process. The three main modules of Primo include
Authoring, Submission/Reviewing, and Proofing, all of which are equipped
with usability checks during submission, a collaborative editing
feature, a \WYSIWYG\ math editing tool, and publisher\slash
journal-based \PDF\ manuscript rendering. With Primo, authors can be
assured that their work will be published with the highest level of
precision and quality.
