Overleaf makes an annual deployment of \TeX\ Live, which we sum up here,
including the testing we perform as part of the deployment process. The
talk at the \tug\ conference was followed by a discussion about
Overleaf's process with regards to \LaTeX\ development and \TeX\ Live
testing; however, this discussion is not captured in this article.
