\emph{Littera capitalis rustica} (literally \emph{country capital letters}) are
a script of the Latin alphabet, the earliest examples of which date back to the
first century \acro{CE}, notably on election posters in the city of Pompeii.
They were gradually regularised in the fourth and fifth
centuries and remained in use until the ninth and tenth centuries, but mostly
for titles and distinctions [1].
