It is natural to think that separating a word up into individual
characters is an easy operation. It turns out that for the computer this isnâ€™t really
the case. If we look at a system that natively understands Unicode (like \hologo{XeTeX}
or \hologo{LuaTeX}), most of the time one \enquote{character} is stored as one
codepoint. A codepoint is a single character entity for a Unicode programme.
