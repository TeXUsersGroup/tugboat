.rpi files written by TUB capsule processing. Public domain.
Originally written 2020 Karl Berry.

See ../README (i.e., the README in the crossref/ subdirectory) for the
general story on our doi setup.

This crossref/dir1.lndout subdirectory is written into by the
../../cr-do-issue script (in the capsules/ directory), and by the other
scripts it calls. It contains the final version of the html landing
pages, and the abs/bbl files which get included in them.

The files written here are intended to be temporary, and are not
committed to version control.
