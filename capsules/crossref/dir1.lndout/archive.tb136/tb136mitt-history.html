<p><b>Abstract</b>:
Depending on how you count we have several LaTeX anniversaries to
celebrate in 2023: roughly forty years ago Leslie Lamport started
his work on LaTeX (which became LaTeX2.09 in 1986). Ten years
later in 1993 we made the first beta version of LaTeX2e
available&#x2014;since then the standard LaTeX version used across
the world.</p>
<p>Thirty years of LaTeX2e does not mean three decades of standstill&#x2014;on the contrary. During that time thirty-six new kernel versions have been
released and the LaTeX ecosystem grew from a few hundred add-on
packages to several thousands.</p>
<p>However, during the first two decades changes to the core of
LaTeX were rather minor and most activity was concentrated in
the package universe, but the last decade showed an increased level
of activity modernizing the LaTeX core functionalities. This
started around 2015 when the LaTeX Project Team reimported bug
fixes accumulated in a separate package back into the kernel. Since
then the format was gradually modernized, e.g., by making UTF-8 the
default in 2018 and by incorporating the L3 programming layer in
2020. This intensified further in the last two years when the team
embarked on a multi-year journey to enable automatic tagging of the
PDF output produced from LaTeX.</p>

Most of these ideas have been implemented in prototype implementations (e.g., template design, front matter handling, output routine, galley and paragraph formatting). The source code is documented and contains further explanations and examples; see also [33].

Coray, editors, &#x2018;EP92&#x2019;&#x2014;Proceedings of Electronic Publishing &#x2019;92, International Conference on Electronic Publishing, Document Manipulation, and Typography, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland, April 7&#x2013;10, 1992, pp. 261&#x2013;273. Cambridge University Press, New York, 1992. ISBN 0-521-43277-4. This paper compares high-quality craft typography with the state of the art in automated typesetting. It explains why the current paradigms of computerized typesetting will not serve for high-quality formatting and suggests directions for the further research necessary to improve the quality of computer-generated layout.</li>
