<p><b>Abstract</b>:
Each Unicode codepoint has many different properties. For example, depending
on our application, we might need to know whether a codepoint is a (lower case)
letter, how it should be treated at a line break, how its width is treated (for
East Asian characters), <em>etc.</em> Unicode provides a range of
data files which tabulate this information. These files are human-readable and
are, in the main, purely ASCII text: they are therefore not tied to any
particular programming language for usage. The full set of files is available
from <a href="https://unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/">https://unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/</a>: the complete current
set as a zip is around 6.7MiB.</p>
<p>There are of course standard libraries for common programming languages such as
C which both load this data and provide implementations of the algorithms which
use this data: things like changing case, breaking text into lines and so on.
However, these are not readily available to us as TeX programmers.
Thus, if we want to be able to properly implement Unicode algorithms, we
will need to look at how to load the relevant data and store it within TeX
in an efficient manner.</p>
<p>Here, I will focus on how the LaTeX team is approaching the data storage
challenge. I will show how the particular requirements of implementing in
TeX mean we need to use a mix of approaches, depending on exactly which data
we are looking at. The current implementation for loading this data in
expl3 is available at
<a href="https://github.com/latex3/latex3/blob/main/l3kernel/l3unicode.dtx">https://github.com/latex3/latex3/blob/main/l3kernel/l3unicode.dtx</a>, and is
read as part of the LaTeX2e format-building process.</p>
