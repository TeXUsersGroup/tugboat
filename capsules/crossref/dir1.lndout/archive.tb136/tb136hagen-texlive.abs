Starting with \TEXLIVE\ 2023 the default \CONTEXT\ distribution is \LMTX, a
follow up on \MKIV, running on top of the \LUAMETATEX\ engine instead of \LUATEX. Already
for a long time the \MKII\ version used with \PDFTEX, \XETEX\ and \ALEPH\ has
been frozen and most users moved on from \MKIV\ to \LMTX\ (a more distinctive tag
for what internally is version \MKXL).
