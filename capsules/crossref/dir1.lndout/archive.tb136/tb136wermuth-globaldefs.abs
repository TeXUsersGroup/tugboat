       This article discusses a single integer parameter of the
program \TeX: It looks at the history of the invention of \cs{globaldefs},
describes the behavior of this internal parameter and tries to list
useful applications. It also warns about constructions that might
lead to faulty results. Moreover, it explains why one must do a
careful verification of someone else's code if that code should be
reused under a setting of \cs{globaldefs}.
