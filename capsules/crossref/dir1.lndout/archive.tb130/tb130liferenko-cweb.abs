We show how to implement \tbUTF-8 support in \acro{CWEB}
by adding the arrays {\it xord\/} and {\it xchr\/}.
Immediately after reading a Unicode character from an input file, we
convert it to an 8-bit character using {\it xord\/}. On output the reverse
operation is done using {\it xchr\/}.
This allows us to leave core algorithms of \acro{CWEB} unchanged.
