  In this short note we discuss the abstract topological aspects of
  fonts and how a simple homotopy deformation can be created to
  transition a glyph in one font to that of another font. We demonstrate
  interesting transitions for some fonts from sans-serif to serif using
  a JavaScript implementation of a simple algorithm. We also discuss
  other cases which involve deformations that map non-homeomorphic
  configurations that involve catastrophic bifurcations.
