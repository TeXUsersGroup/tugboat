2021 was a challenging year for the Island of \TeX: roadmap changes, lack of resources,
server limitations. Yet, resilience, persistence and a bit of good humour made the island
even stronger, with new joiners, community support, bold plans and an even brighter future
for the \TeX{} ecosystem. And all just in time for celebrating 10 years of arara,
our beloved bird!
