This keynote presentation addresses how recent trends to align technical
documentation practices with ``de\-veloper-friendly'' workflows may be
detrimental to documentation authors and their users. A proposed
solution is in the recent past of technical documentation as a
discipline, where tools and ideas rooted in structured authoring and
markup, reuse, and personalization can still provide solutions to
present\Dash and future\Dash needs related to technical content.
