Typesetting units is an important task for scientists and engineers. When done
in \AllTeX{}, it is natural to use a macro-based approach to carry out the

\pkg{siunitx}, which I've looked at in \emph{TUGboat}.
Last year, I launched version~3 of
\pkg{siunitx} after development over several years. Here, I will recap why this
came about and how I went about launching the latest version.
