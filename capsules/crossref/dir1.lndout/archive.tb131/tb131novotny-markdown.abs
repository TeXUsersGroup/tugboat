Celebrating its fifth birthday, the Markdown package has received five
new features: user-defined \LaTeX{} themes, \LaTeX{} setup snippets,
semantic \HTML\ comments, lexical \TeX{} comments, and support for the
LuaMeta\TeX{} engine. In this article, we introduce each of these
features and show how they can be used in practice. We also discuss five
ideas for the future of Markdown and show how you can help turn them
into a reality.
