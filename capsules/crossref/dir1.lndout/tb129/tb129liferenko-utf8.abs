In its design \TeX\ has the concepts of ``internal
encoding'' and ``external encoding''. This fact
allows \TeX\ to work with any encoding.
We use Unicode as \TeX's external encoding.
Then we change the necessary parts of \TeX\ to
use \hbox{\tbUTF-8} as the
input/output encoding.
The resulting implementation passes
the {\tt trip} test.
