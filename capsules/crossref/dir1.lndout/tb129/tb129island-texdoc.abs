\begin{abstract}
When looking for \TeX-related documentation, users have many options,
including running \texttt{texdoc} on their local machine, looking up the
package at \CTAN, or using a service like \tbsurl{texdoc.net}. As the latter is
known for lacking regular updates, the Island of \TeX\ decided to take
the opportunity to provide a complete rewrite of the provided service
using a \acro{REST}ful \API\ and a self-updating Docker container.
