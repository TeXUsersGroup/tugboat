It is quite common in typographic terminology to divide the world's
scripts into Latin and non-Latins. At first glance that might seem to be
a reasonable categorization until one looks a bit closer to find that
non-Latin consists of a huge number of diverse scripts. Imagine if we
were to call Latin script blue, while calling all others non-blue. We
would be gathering the remaining colors of the spectrum into one group
without differentiation. Calling a color non-blue doesn't tell us
anything about what it might be; is it orange, green, magenta, indigo?
