At the 2021 \CONTEXT\ meeting I did a presentation about rendering
so-called open street maps with \METAPOST. I will roughly describe
what it takes and show some \TEX, \METAPOST, \LUA, and \XML.

These are maps available on the web and in some mobile applications made
from contributions by (public) organizations, governments, and
volunteers. On the web these maps are rendered efficiently from cached
tiles (bitmaps).
