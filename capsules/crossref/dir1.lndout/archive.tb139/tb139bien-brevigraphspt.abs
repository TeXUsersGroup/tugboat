The fonts of several 16th century printers active in Poland,
namely Aleksander Augezdecki, Jan Haller, Kasper Hochfeder, Florian
Ungler (the first and second printing house) and Maciej WirzbiÄ™ta, have
been described in the series of 12 fascicules entitled
\textit{Polonia {Typographica} {Saeculi} {Sedecimi}} published in years
1959--1981. We examine variations of the glyphs in the printed output.
