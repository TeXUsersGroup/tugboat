.rpi files written by TUB capsule processing. Public domain.
Originally written 2020 Karl Berry.

See ../README (i.e., the README in the crossref/ subdirectory) for the
general story on our doi story and ../Makefile for the exact steps.

This crossref/rpi subdirectory is written into by the capsule processing
script (captub), specifically by capcrossref.pl::crossref_write_files.

The .rpi files written here are intended to be temporary and
intermediate, and are not committed to version control.
