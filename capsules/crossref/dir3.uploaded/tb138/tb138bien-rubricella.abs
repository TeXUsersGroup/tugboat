  The goal of the paper is twofold.  One goal is to present a minor
  contribution to the task of describing the character inventory of a
  16th century Polish printing house; for this purpose it is necessary
  to present also some theoretical aspects of the task. Another one is
  to discuss the use of \XeLaTeX{} and other tools in the author's
  workflow.
