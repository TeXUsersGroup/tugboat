A new tutorial on the Ti\emph{k}Z package for vector graphics in \LaTeX\ is 
presented. Rendering binary-encoded data of the interstellar Arecibo message, 
into a digital image, was used as the learning exercise. Demonstration of 
data indexing, multidimensional lists, nested loops, string concatenation, 
variable declarations, and more, are given for budding Ti\emph{k}Z 
enthusiasts. The material also has potential for adaptation to custom rendering 
2D data matrices more generally.
