We present some tools that allow us to parse all or part of \AllTeX\ source
files and process suitable information. For example, we can use them to extract
some metadata of a document. These tools have been developed in the \pgScheme{}
functional programming language. Using them requires only basic knowledge of
functional programming and \pgScheme. Besides, these tools could be easily
implemented using a strongly typed functional programming language, such as
\pgname{Standard \acro{ML}} or \pgname{Haskell}.
