This paper describes the development and usage of the \texttt{luatruthtable}
package in \LaTeX. It is developed to generate truth tables of boolean
values in \LaTeX\ documents. The package provides an easy way of generating
truth tables in \LaTeX. There is no need of a special \LaTeX\ environment
for generation of truth tables with the package. It is written in Lua and
the \TeX\ document is to be compiled with the \LuaLaTeX\ engine.
