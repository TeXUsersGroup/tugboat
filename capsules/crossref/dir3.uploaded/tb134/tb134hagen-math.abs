We report on some recent work on mathematical typesetting.
Our main purpose has been to make both the input and output of math cleaner 
and more structured. 
Among the many enhancements, we mention here the introduction of new atom 
classes that has given better control over many details.
We also cover the unboxing of fenced material which, together with 
improved line-breaking and more flexible 
multiline display math, has created a coherent way to produce displayed 
formulas that split over lines.
