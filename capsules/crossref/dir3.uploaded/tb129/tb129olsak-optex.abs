\OpTeX\ [1] is a new format prepared for Lua\TeX{}. It keeps Plain \TeX{}'s
simplicity, adds the power of the OPmac macros [2] and leaves behind the old
obscurities with non-Unicode fonts and with various \TeX{} engines. 
It provides a powerful font selection system, colors, graphics, references, 
hyperlinks, syntax highlighting, preparing indexes and bibliography
listings. All these features are implemented at \TeX{} macro level and they
are ready to use without any external program.
\OpTeX\ is a new Plain \TeX{} suitable for the present.
