Most font editors offer curvature-related tools. One of these tools is
the visualization of curvature via \emph{curvature combs}. Another tool
is so-called \emph{harmonization}, which makes the curvature
continuous along paths. An implementation of both tools in \MP{} will be
presented. Curvature-optimized paths already play a significant role in
\MF{} and \MP{} and therefore example \MP{} paths will be examined for
their curvature behavior.
