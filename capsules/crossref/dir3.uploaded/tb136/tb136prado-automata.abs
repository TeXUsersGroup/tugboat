    This article is a quick introduction to \TikZ's \texttt{automata}
    library, used for the design and typesetting of finite automata in
    \LaTeX. It also explores the use of \TeX\ loops and conditionals to
    automate the generation of images that follow noticeable patterns.
    \TikZ\ itself is a package used for generating a variety of
    figures\Dash from geometry configurations to graphs and
    automata\Dash allowing for more control over image editing and
    quality. Although the package is very versatile, its uses for
    designing automata will be the primary topic of this article.
