Most articles that describe how to use the \sty{glossaries} package
consider a single sorted list or possibly multiple lists where each
list has a different set of entries (terms, symbols, abbreviations,
etc.).  However, some documents may instead have each term described
in the main matter, with references to the term linking back to that
point in the document rather than to a summary list. Alternatively
(or additionally) a document may have multiple lists consisting of
the same set of entries ordered in different ways.
