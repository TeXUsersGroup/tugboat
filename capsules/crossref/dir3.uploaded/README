crossref-related files saved for posterity. Public domain.
Originally written 2020 Karl Berry.

See ../README (i.e., the README in the crossref/ subdirectory) for the
general story on our doi setup.

The files here are what has been uploaded to Crossref. They are saved
here in the event that corrections are necessary, so that it's not
necessary to go through all the regeneration steps. They shouldn't be
changed except to fix mistakes and re-upload, by hand.
