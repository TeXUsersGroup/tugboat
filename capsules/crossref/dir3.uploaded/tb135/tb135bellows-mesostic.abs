  \LaTeX{} is useful not only for producing beautifully typeset
  math and science   papers but can be just as useful for the
  typesetting demands of modern poetry. This includes a style
  of poetry called \textit{mesostics} that was created by the
  poet Jackson Mac Low and embraced and extended by the late
  composer John Cage; it is Cage's approach to mesostics that
  I will be addressing in this paper. I will show how I use
  \LaTeX{} to automatically format my own computer-generated
  mesostics.
