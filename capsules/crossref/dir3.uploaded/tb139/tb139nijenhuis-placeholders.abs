        This article examines the implementation of the invoice template
        in GinVoice~[3] and explores how the invoice
        template can better align with the \LaTeX\ ecosystem by
        introducing an additional data layer in \YAML\ using
        \texttt{lua-placeholders}. With the introduction of
        \texttt{lua-placeholders}, \LaTeX\ users have complete freedom
        in formatting invoice templates, and the invoice templates are
        directly integratable with the enhanced version of GinVoice.
