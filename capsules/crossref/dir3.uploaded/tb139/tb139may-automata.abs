In this article, we discuss a new software tool that interacts with 
Grail+, a library of automata-theoretic command-line utilities. Our 
software, the Grail+\ Visualizer, takes the textual representation of a 
finite automaton produced by Grail+\ and generates \TikZ\ code to 
illustrate the finite automaton, with automatic layout of states and 
transitions. In addition to giving an overview of the basics of automata 
theory and Grail+, we discuss how the Grail+\ Visualizer works in 
detail and suggest avenues for future work.
