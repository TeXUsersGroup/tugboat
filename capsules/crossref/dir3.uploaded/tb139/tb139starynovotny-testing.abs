In the version 3.0.0 of the Markdown package for \TeX, the number of regression tests increased from 143 to 783. This caused the tests to run for up to 15~hours, which slowed down our development cycle.
In this article, we describe a novel technique for batching test files that reduced our testing time from 15 hours to just 15 minutes. With batching, the amount of time that is spent on actual testing increased from 5\% to 97\%. When combined with multiprocessing on 32 \acro{CPU}s, our batching technique achieved a speed increase of up to 161 times compared to running without any multiprocessing or batching.
