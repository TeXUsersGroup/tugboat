The GUST{} e-foundry's set of interrelated projects that are reported
on here was conceived in 2015. The main goal of those projects was to
add mathematical, technical and geometrical symbols to all of the \TeX{}
Gyre text fonts with the exception of \TeX{} Gyre Chorus (excluded as
such symbols seem of little use in a chancery font).
