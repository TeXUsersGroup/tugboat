TUGboat capsules processing. Public domain.
Originally written 2017 Karl Berry.
David Walden did a completely different implementation years before;
the present code was written from scratch.

captub          main program; see comments at top for the general
                implementation strategy.

capaccum*       accumulated lists across all issues.
capconv		within-capsule conversion from input TeX to output HTML or txt.
capcrossref     doi support; see also ./crossref/README, etc.
capin		read tb*capsule.tex files, plus some whole-issue conversions.
capout		output contents*.html files.
caputil		debugging fns, etc.

capdata-rx	handle data file lists-regexps.txt.
capdata-unify	handle lists-unifications.txt.
capdata-xlate	handle lists-translations.txt.

lists-authinfo      decorations for authors in Crossref.
lists-regexps       Perl substitutions.
lists-translations  convert TeX fragments to HTML and sortable ASCII.
lists-unifications  different category/author/title forms to be combined.

This capsule processing is one part of publishing a TUGboat issue; see
the end of the README.karl file on tug.org for the overall sequence of
operations.

Consider "todo:" items if you're looking for something to do.


(later changes, and some early, in ChangeLog)

26jan19 check for pagenos lacking a range, update many capsule files.

18jan19 count regexps, remove unused and used only once.

17jan19 remove unused unifications.

16jan19 count unifications.

13jan19 remove a few of translations used only once, adjust sources.

10jan19 reenable xlate_dump_count, try reporting 1 hit. strange 0:
0 (?^:\\textcircumacute\{e\})||&#x1ebf;
but it is needed for Thanh abbrev?

9jan19  reenable difficulty/category checking.

7jan19  finish first draft of article, assorted cleanups.

29dec18 let's just keep bare &, not switch to &amp; shorter.

25dec18 %person names must not use braces. names for obituaries.

25dec18 %person augment rather than replace. names for book reviews.

24dec18 deploy in production first time.

18dec18 move to single directory in svn.

17dec18 more subroutines for lists output.

16dec18 han=thanh special case. little html cleanup. author review continues.

14dec18 handle %person. start reviewing all authors, more unifications.

12dec18 couple more translations/unifications.
start setting up article.

11dec18 more translations/unifications over the past few days.
split author lists at \& also.
need to get rid of all accentless->accented unifications.

6dec18 finish (none) cleanup. more accent translations instead of whole names.

6dec18 continue (none) cleanup. report untranslated author entities,
begin translations.

5dec18 continue (none) cleanup. start html2txt for authors, sort string
and anchor can be the same here (in contrast to titles)?
untranslated entity check is in Makefile, maybe should be in code?

3dec18 continue (none) cleanup.
report one-word authors, most likely un-unified.

2dec18 continue (none) cleanup. more last name/et al. abstracts unifications.

30nov18 split authors at \s+and\s+.
continue (none) cleanup.

28nov18 continue (none) cleanup, author_html hash needed as with titles
or don't know what to print. author split in capconv not correct.

27nov18 continue (none) cleanup, first output of author list.

25nov18 first glimmerings of author list.

24nov18 split capaccum-title into subroutines.

23nov18 finish cahi sl.

22nov18 cahi sl start. split lists generation into separate files.

21nov18 dtk sl continues (brace parsing messed).
split output_keyword_list into subroutines.

20nov18 hiw subheads finished, more dtk sl.

19nov18 beet subheads finished, start hiw, continue journals with komo.
output title index sequence.

18nov18 hex 327, not decimal, for the combining cedilla for \c{S} in schaefer.
start italicizing journal names with maps.

16nov18 %replace Interfaces.
listkeyword S\u{N}\"aferTeX still wrong.

14nov18 finish %add for Keynotes.

12nov18 handle that &ouml (semicolon was removed) in dtk anchor name.

11nov18 output visible #anchor as with keywords.
title_unify_journals first cut, as deleting everything after a colon or
  comma was too much, lots of regular titles would be wrongly merged.
komodie still has &ouml in anchor.

 9nov18 been doing beet subheads and category consolidation, 25-0 public,
while working on library stuff.
listkeyword and S\u{N}\"aferTeX still wrong.

 4nov18 Print (pre)sort string for consolidated titles.
Too many colons and commas in titles; have to do the journals,
Addresses, anything else, as special cases.

 1nov18 include all subtitles except book reviews, not just beet.
Beginning of handling consolidated titles.
Survey should be Surveys for listkeywords for consistency.
listkeyword shows S\u{N}\"aferTeX!

31oct18 include beet subtitles in listtitle.html; maybe should do all?
Random first element of consolidated titles still pending.

30oct18 remove all punct except & and , instead of listing them.
Handle \ss$ in lists-regexps for Herbert.

29oct18 remove stray ^; remove accents from lists-regexps and add more
to lists-translations.

28oct18 translate more kerns out, unify on \Thanh.
Have been consolidating small categories for a couple of weeks now, lots more.
?remove stray &
?don't need accents in regexps?
?tugabstracts shows random first element.

25oct18 more accent translations. convert from html, not tex.

24oct18 remember empty txt translations, skip only undefined.
reduce \l, \varepsilon translations.

23oct18 html2txt attempt, no difference yet.
need to distinguish empty txt arg from not present.
maybe try removing all non-alphanumeric (except ,) instead of individual chars?
reduce \"o translations.

21oct18 factor out vol_iss_link used in the lists.

19oct18 /TUGboat/Contents/ for contents*.html links.
more title_sort cleanups. But going to need to do list-xlate and/or list-rx.

18oct18 construct anchors from titles, more sorting refinements (SPC, nbsp).
need to make intro link list.

16oct18 display title html, not sort string. case-insensitive title search.
need to handle leading number in anchor.

14oct18 start dump of title list. was shifting off author_html by reference.
still need to factor out issue ref at end, title anchor vs. sort.

13oct18 small continuation of making title list.

12oct18 start title list, factor out more. Have common text for
title+author, maybe duplicate?

11oct18 output visible #cattag.

 8oct18 factor out common code to accumulation().
need to make #cattag.

 7oct18 special-case munging to sort of listkeyword entries.
need to move common code out of list_category_output.

 5oct18 sorting of listkeyword entries; need sortable (no markup) title?
also consistently italicize journal titles via lists-*?

 4oct18 output real html for each capsule in listkeyword.html.

21sep18 continue cleanup of current categories. further on new output.

20sep18 %replace and %add working I think, including transform_category
so that unification works in a unified way.

15sep18 first attempt at category directives %replace and %add.

10sep18 more field name doc, etc., thinking about directives.

 9sep18 don't use &amp; for categories so we can compare to current output.

 7sep18 reminded that categories don't do full tex2html, no
lists-translations; "\Dash " occurred in tb56. Pain with & (unified) vs. &amp;

 6sep18 further with category printing.

 4sep18 factor out common header/footer, use for contents and listkeyword.

 2sep18 save all issue hashes in %accum, begin keyword list.
need to factor out header/footer.
eventually check if passing % vs. $ makes a difference?

26aug18 accumulation_check for all and only categories and difficulties.

24aug18 more author split regex, was getting warnings from empty author
strings. copy in @expected lists in preparation.

23aug18 no capture groups in split regex, matched string gets returned.

22aug18 \difficulty same as \category.

21aug18 handle next/prev of first [0]9 issues.

20aug18 handle subtitles, nicer html output.

17aug18 tbNN and other small consistencies in HTML output.

12aug18 handle subtitles, with \\$ to <br> before tex2html.

10aug18 separate original category (for html) from unified category
(for lists). Simplify category html transform.

8aug18 first attempt at implementing category unification.

7aug18 find more category unifications.

6aug18 after removing most of the zeros, time is 3.5-3.9sec, about the same.
but removing the tex2html on difficulty and redo on category in
capsule_convert got us to 3.0sec.

4aug18  about half the translations are only used once. many redundant
or wrong accent translations? could also move author-only translations
to a separate file, but maybe performance is good enough.

1aug18  the s/$tex/$html/g in xlate_tex2html is by far the biggest consumer.
I think all we can do is try to cut down the number of xlate entries.
the eval/eeg in lists_regexps is the second biggest, but about 1/6 as
much (2.4sec vs. 13.4)

27jul18 ok, processing all issues in 3.5sec, no unparsed (added check
for href=""), qr// is used, fixed some html in capsules.

23jul18 accent replacements in lists-regexps should obviate many entries
in lists-translations -- except we need them for txt, I guess.

22jul18 discover href="", add to unparsed test.

eval of our /eeg is not ideal since we don't have filename info
available, but oh well, have to grep. Discover that a few capsules use
HTML entities in authors and titles, due to:
  Warning `Use of uninitialized value in substitution iterator at
  /r/tug/home/httpd/html/TUGboat/tocs/k/capdata-rx.pl line 23.
  ' while evaluating: s/(?^:\\c\{(.)\})/"$1&#x327;/eeg
  for string: &auml;ferTeX: Source code esthetics for automated typesetters
  (tb79 -> 25-0)
But the actual error was a missing " on the lists-regexps line.

After figuring out /eeg, put back qr's.

19jul18 missed one @tex_strs -> @tex_exprs in capdata-unify.

15jul18 first xlate, then regexps, then (for author) unify.

5jul18 fix most remaining missing pdfs.

4jul18 first attempt at url checking, found a couple of dozen.

3jul18 3.90sec with prevnext (for all issues), 1.43 with --no-prevnext;
wasn't passing right $control argument. Now same with and without.
But nothing is actually working, lots of $1 in output, etc.

2jul18  all issues in one run shows that regexps_apply is the only thing
that might be improved; normalize_whitespace et al. becomes irrelevant.
Total time is slightly longer, maybe because of prevnext.

1jul18  tried combining some lists-regexps, did not decrease total time.
guess we're out of easy things to try. commenting out all the entries
did save ~10ms, but evidently more complex regexps take just as long or
longer than more entries.

29jun18 change lists-regexps.txt to || format also, precompile the lhs
  with qr//. regexps_apply now about 15%, but _match_bracketed is the
  top, about 25%. Total time for all issues down to 4-5sec (Dave's
  "assembler" is 3.7sec). Could probably get faster by merging regexps
  with the same target, removing some lists- items, etc.

28jun18 moving quotemeta to compilation instead of xlate_tex2html makes
  little difference (~2%).
precompile regexps into qr// objects for lists-translations,
  which brings CORE::regcomp down to 2% of time, regexps_apply is now ~30%.
xlate_tex2html is still also about ~30%, but probably can't do much more
  globally; could probably eliminate/simplify some of the translations.
  maybe keep a count of how many times each has been applied?
total time for all issues down to 12sec.

19jun18 too slow to do them all routinely - 46sec to do 120 issues,
which is too long.

So install and run -d:NYTProf, processing one issue, to get profiling
per line (standard -dDProf only yields data per subroutine). running nytprof
-> file:///r/tug/home/httpd/html/TUGboat/tocs/capsule/nytprof/index.html
shows ~1/4 total time spent in my regexps_apply (for lists-regexps)
and 1/4 time spent in CORE::regcomp (for lists-translations).

26apr18 basically working without indexes

go through issues, finding unbalanced \{\}braces,
typos in category names etc., but
mostly adding \offset to avoid special case for early issues.
