# -r1200 is to avoid rendering on a tiny canvas, which can trip
#   heuristics of complicated fonts, as (relating to a Hans font) in:
#   https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=701753 
# -dAutoRotatePages since no, we do not want pages randomly rotated.
# -dCompressFonts seems not to hurt, and can save notable space.
# -dDetectDuplicateImages similarly.
# -dEmbedAllFonts usually but doesn't always work to embed fonts,
#   except that if downscaling images with zres, have to override.
# -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress needed for embedding with
#   45-2/watters-litigator/doc.pdf (tb140)
# -dPrinted=false is to preserve internal links within the pdf,
#   notably for the cover/cover3 in our tb*complete.pdf:
#   https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/456896

# Re image compression, the default seems good enough for us, since we
# usually do want some sort of compression. explanation of many options,
# including the way to see all default settings for pdfwrite:
# https://superuser.com/questions/360216/use-ghostscript-but-tell-it-to-not-reprocess-images
# namely:
# gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -o /dev/null \
#    -c "currentpagedevice { exch ==only ( ) print == } forall"
#
# but if we ever did want to leave images alone, maybe (from that same page):
# -dColorConversionStrategy=/LeaveColorUnchanged \
# -dDownsampleColorImages=false \
# -dDownsampleGrayImages=false \
# -dDownsampleMonoImages=false \
# -dAutoFilterColorImages=false \
# -dAutoFilterGrayImages=false \
# -dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
# -dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode \
# -dMonoImageFilter=/CCITTFaxEncode

# other random options sometimes of interest:
# -dDEVICEWIDTHPOINTS=679 -dDEVICEHEIGHTPOINTS=1598
# -sPAPERSIZE=a4

# See also https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt and sam2p, maybe.
