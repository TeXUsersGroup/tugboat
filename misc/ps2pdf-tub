# with gs 9.14 (tb109reviews-xie), -dPDFX=true fails with annotations,
# -dEmbedAllFonts doesn't (didn't) always,
# -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress works so far to ensure embedded fonts,
#   except that if downscaling images with zres, have to override.
# -dAutoRotatePages since of course we do not want pages randomly rotated,
# -dCompressFonts seems not to hurt, and can save notable space.
# -dDetectDuplicateImages similarly,
# -dPrinted=false is to preserve internal links within the pdf,
#   notably for the cover/cover3 in our tb*complete.pdf
#   (https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/456896).
