This is http://mirror.ctan.org/info/digests/tugboat/hyphenex.

This directory contains scripts to generate hyphenation exceptions,
hyphenex.pl and hyphenex.sh, written by Werner Lemberg.  The two scripts
(shell and Perl) do exactly the same thing, namely convert the TUGboat
master list (available as tb0hyf.tex) to a TeX-readable file (available
as ushyphex.tex).

If questions, problems, or suggestions for additional exceptions, please
email tugboat@tug.org.
