This is https://ctan.org/pkg/hyphenex.

This directory contains the TeX-readable file of hyphenation exceptions
for U.S. English: ushyphex.tex. It is one long call to \hyphenation{...}.

It is maintained by the TUGboat editors. If questions, problems, or
suggestions for additional exceptions, please email tugboat@tug.org.

Also here is the master file for the exceptions, maintained as a TUGboat
article: tb0hyf.tex. Updates are printed in TUGboat from time to time;
the exact list is given in the file.

Also here are scripts to generate ushyphex.tex from tb0hyf.tex:
hyphenex.pl and hyphenex.sh, written by Werner Lemberg. The two scripts
(shell and Perl) do exactly the same thing.

All of the material in hyphenex is either public domain or under an
all-permissive license.

P.S. There is another set of hyphenation patterns and exceptions for
English, known as "usenglishmax", which defines many additional
hyphenation points. It is included in the hyph-utf package:
https://ctan.org/pkg/hyph-utf8. It was created by Gerard Kuiken and is
unrelated to the material here.
