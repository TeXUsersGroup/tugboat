These documents are from Cenveo, specifically Kelli Parmenter,
April 2020.

WF1_UploadOnly.pdf shows the upload process on their web site,
with illustrations.

FileSpecs_2020.pdf shows the requirements for automatic processing after
uploads, including TrimBox, color processing, etc. We don't do this.
There is no cost savings. The only difference is whether the first
processing step (before we approve the pages) is done by them or us,
and since they do it very quickly, and it would be a lot of new work for
us, there is no motivation to do so.
